# Simple Rules for Simple Code

    1. Don't abbreviate your code, but don't exceed two words (aka no $thisIsACoolVariable, rather $coolVariable)
    2. Never use the `else` keyword. Use a Defensive Programming to check logic or leverage polymorphism.
    3. One Level of indentation per method! 
    4. Limit Instance Variables.
    5. Wrap Primitives (Sometimes) - String, ints, booleans.
        When to wrap...
        - Does it bring clarity?
        - Is there behavior associated with primitive?
        - Consistency.
        - Does it represent an important concept in domain?
